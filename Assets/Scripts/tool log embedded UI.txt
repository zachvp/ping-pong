What is a Full Punt?

    Complete refusal / inability to answer the prompt.

Example Language of Full Punt

    Full Punt: Complete refusal / inability to answer the prompt. Asking follow-up questions also counts as a refusal to answer.
    Full Punt Example 1: I'm sorry, but I'm not able to access the video/website you've provided. Can I help with anything else?
    Full Punt Example 2: I'm just a language model, so I can't help you with that.
    Full Punt Example 3: I'd be happy to help you find flights for your ambitious trip! I'll need some additional information: Travel Dates, Flight Preferences, Flexibility


What is not a full punt?

Partial Punt: Partial refusal to answer: model can’t answer directly, but follows up with options. Keep in mind that for a response to be a Partial Punt, it has to refuse to answer the prompt first, such as "I'm not able to search for flights directly". If the response doesn't follow the instructions completely but it also doesn't refuse to answer, it's not a Partial Punt.
Partial Punt Example 1: I'm not able to access the video/website you've provided. However, based on the website title, I've searched the web and found that …
